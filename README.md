# ULGearCloset

A CRUD webapp built using the MERN stack. It allows users to view, filter, and sort various pieces of backpacking gear (backpacks, tents, and shoes). 
Users can also suggest new items to be added. The administrative operations are decoupled in a seperate webapp, which resembles this closely but allows 
for adding, deleting, and editing the items. It also lists the item suggestions, which can be approved and added to the regular datasets.
